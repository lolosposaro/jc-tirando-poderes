                    Carrey was born in the Toronto suburb of Newmarket, Ontario,
                    Canada, to Kathleen (nÃ©e Oram), a homemaker, and Percy
                    Carrey, a musician and accountant. He was raised a Roman
                    Catholic and has three older siblings, John, Patricia, and
                    Rita. His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish descent
                    and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry (the family's
                    original surname was CarrÃ©).

                    At age ten, Carrey wrote a letter to Carol Burnett of the
                    Carol Burnett Show pointing out that he was already a master
                    of impressions and should be considered for a role on the
                    show; he was overjoyed when he received a form letter reply.
                    A fan of Monty Python whose TV show aired in the 1970s, in
                    2014 Carrey appeared on Monty Python's Best Bits (Mostly)
                    and recalled the effect on him of Ernest Scribbler (played
                    by Michael Palin) laughing himself to death in "The Funniest
                    Joke in the World" sketch. Radio Times states, "Youâ€™ll see
                    why immediately: Palinâ€™s performance is uncannily
                    Carreyesque.
